Credit Card Fraud Detection using Isolation Forest
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets using the Isolation Forest algorithm. The Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm particularly well-suited for anomaly detection, making it an ideal choice for identifying potential fraud.

Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant problem worldwide, costing financial institutions and cardholders billions of dollars annually. This project implements an Isolation Forest model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data.

Isolation Forest is an ensemble method that identifies anomalies by isolating observations. Unlike other techniques that rely on distance or density measures, Isolation Forest works by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. The basic principle is that anomalies are few and different, and thus they are easier to isolate.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a commonly available dataset for credit card fraud detection. It includes transactions made by European cardholders over a two-day period in September 2013. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

Features: 30 numerical input variables.
Target Variable: A binary variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Model Overview
Isolation Forest
Isolation Forest detects anomalies by isolating observations. The key idea is that anomalies are few and different; they are easier to separate. The Isolation Forest algorithm randomly selects a feature and then randomly selects a split value between the minimum and maximum of the selected feature. The process repeats recursively, and the number of splits required to isolate a point is a measure of its "normality." Points that require fewer splits are more likely to be anomalies.

Model Parameters
n_estimators: The number of base estimators in the ensemble.
max_samples: The number of samples to draw from the dataset to train each base estimator.
contamination: The proportion of outliers in the data set.
max_features: The number of features to draw from the dataset to train each base estimator.
